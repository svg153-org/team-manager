	// This test should simulate the GitHub Actions workflow triggered by issue labels for team creation.
	// It should validate that the workflow correctly triggers the necessary jobs and updates `team-assignments.yaml` accordingly.
	// The test should cover the following:
	// - Simulate the creation of an issue with the label 'team creation'.
	// - Validate that the GitHub Actions workflow is triggered.
	// - Verify that the workflow runs the correct jobs for team creation.
	// - Check that `team-assignments.yaml` is updated with the new team details.
	// - Ensure that a pull request is created with the changes to `team-assignments.yaml`.
	// - Confirm that the issue is closed after the pull request is merged.
	// Note: This is a placeholder for the actual test implementation.
